This is a site where you can choose your own favourite cricketers and make your own team . And I am making this using react to learn it.

# NavBar

here is sections like Home,Fixture,Teams,Schedules and a coin credit where you can see your coin balance .

# Banner
here is a banner where you can see the banner image and some title about the page and also a button for claiming Coin Free .
when you click on the button you will get a alert message that you have claimed 5000000 coins .
